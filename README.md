# AWK Data Analytics Workshop 

## Introduction

To host the data analytics workshop, a reduced file structure compared to the structure for development is used. 
The file structure for development can be found in the AWK Group AG directorty "awkgroupag/DA_Data_Analytics_Mgmt_Workshop" (https://github.com/awkgroupag/DA_Data_Analytics_Mgmt_Workshop). 
Main reason for the reduced version is a cleaner look during the workshop and to ensure that participants of the workshop do not see files, that are not relevant for them.

## Initializing the Workshop

To create an environment for workshop participants to use the provided jupyter notebooks, the online service "binder" (https://mybinder.org/) is used:
* Make sure that the used GitHub directory is set to "Public"
* Create an interactive notebook on the binder website: https://mybinder.org/
  * GitHub repository name or URL: Insert GitHub URL for this repositors
  * Git ref: "main"
  * Copy the created link for distribution and later access.
  * Press "Launch" 
* The created interactive notebook can be used by the participants of the workshop.

## Notes

* Open the link to load the notebooks some minutes before the workshops to be set when the workshop starts.
* When closing the notebook, all changes will be reverted. 
* In case permanent changes need to be made, please do so in the code on GitHub.
* Before starting the course check that the internet-settings (Exp: VPN) at the Workshop-location and the laptops of participants allow access to "mybinder". The VPN might need to be disabled for the duration of the course.
